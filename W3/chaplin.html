    <h1 span class="headerh1">The great dictator</h1>


    <!-- Chaplin 1939
    The Final Speech from The Great Dictator. I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I
    don't
    want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We
    all want
    to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness - not by each other's
    misery.
    We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich
    and
    can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.
    Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
    We
    have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our
    knowledge
    has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we
    need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent
    and all
    will be lost. -->
